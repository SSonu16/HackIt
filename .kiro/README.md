development approach used in building this project.

## How Kiro Was Used

- Defining the problem statement and user roles
- Structuring multilingual and voice-first user flows
- Designing AI-assisted price discovery and negotiation logic
- Ensuring accessibility for low-literacy and rural users

and documents how prompt-based reasoning influenced the system design.
